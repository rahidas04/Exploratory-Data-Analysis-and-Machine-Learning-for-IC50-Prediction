Welcome to my Fall 2024 Cornell Data Journal Project repository! This project focused on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning to predict IC50 values based on drug names and cancer types!

This project explores the relationship between drug sensitivity and cancer cell response using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset. The aim is to provide insights into cancer therapeutics and build a predictive model to estimate IC50 values, enabling researchers and clinicians to better understand drug efficacy.
